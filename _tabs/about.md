Nothing Interesting really, But I do like studying Math and Statistics. I learned about Data Science and have liked programming since childhood. I like reading books and going to random places. Maybe I will make a post about them too.

I like dumb and unfunny jokes, and always have failed to remain serious and dedicate myself to something. I really hate it, and always try to fix it but have never been able to achieve it. I also like Game developemnt as a hobby, especially using Unity or Python (pyGame Library). Have created somethings using them. I also like marathons.

Always have had an interest in physics maybe one day I will do something with that.
