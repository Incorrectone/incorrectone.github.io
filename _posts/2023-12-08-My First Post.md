# We sail, boys!

Working pretty well, frankly better than I expected, hopefully this can get going now. I kinda always have wanted to create a blog for the random things I did but I never really ever completed it, frankly cause as of writing this blog/introduction post I really suck at HTML/CSS. There is nothing more I hate than not being able to implement what I envisioned in the demo/image I created in my head. I will probably change the theme with a site that I create after I learn all about CSS but for now I really liked the chirpy theme after seeing someone else use it. So here I am now, using it too.

Till the next blog I make, I want to start on one of the things I have planned.

- [x] Intro post
- [ ] Make a Paint-like App using Python from scratch
- [ ] Make a Paint-like App using C/C++ from scratch
- [ ] Make a Snake Game on an ESP32
- [ ] Make a Paint-Like Thingy on an ESP32
- [ ] Learn Assembly for embedded controllers
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Learn and Remodel my Site

As you can see I kind of want learn more about Embedded things and Optimization, (also Robotics but maybe later)

> Also for full disclosure, Google analytics is enabled on this jekyll site, for ya know so that I can see what are the type of people visit me are. And Cloudflare CDN is responsible for Image hosting! There will never be any Adverts on my blogs.
