# Learning Computer Graphics

There I was wondering where should I should start with computer graphics, while searching on search engines is useful when you know what are looking for, it has kind of the opposite effect when trying to look for answers for learning topics when you know nothing about the topic itself. Computer Graphics is a big topic. Someone on reddit recommended the book [Computer Graphics from Scratch by Gabriel Gambetta.](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/) Primarily a book about 3D rendering techniques for beginners it was a pretty good introduction for Ray-Tracing and 3D Rasterization.
